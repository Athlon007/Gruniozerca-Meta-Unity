# Gruniożerca Meta Unity 
This is a small project of mine created at the end of 2018 holidays. It's a remake of a game made by [Dark Archon](https://twitter.com/archonik) from arhn.eu of a [Gruniożerca Meta](https://github.com/arhneu/gruniozerca-meta) game made for Gamebuino Meta console.

Anyway, this is 95% accurate remake of the game mentioned above made with Unity3D engine. 

# How do I play it?
Download the corresponding archive for your operating system (eg. gruniożerca-meta-win32.zip) . 
At the time of the release there are packages for Windows and Linux and unpack it. After that check the included README file

## Controls
- WASD - movement
- J - Switch guinea pigs / Accept

# Using the source code
So you can do everything with this. You don't have to, but it would be nice if you mention the original author :)

The code has been compiled in Unity 2018.2.5f1, so you should use it or newer version (although everything should work without any problems on older 2018 versions anyway). Scripting backend used is a Mono and scripting runtime version is .NET 4.x Equivalent


_Proudly made on Linux_
